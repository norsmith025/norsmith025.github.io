    "text": "Hey there, thanks for stopping by my website! I’m Nora and I’m a fourth-year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara majoring in Environmental Studies. I’m from San Jose, CA, just about 4.5 hours north of sunny Santa Barbara, and grew up going to the Santa Cruz beaches all the time. I transfered here as a third-year from De Anza Community College in Cupertino, CA, but before that I went to Portland State University for my Freshman year before I decided that the coast was calling me back. I’ll be finishing up my studies here this summer (2025) and can’t wait to see what the future holds!"

    "text": "I couldn’t decide on one of my interests to talk about, so I thought that I would briefly cover a few of them for y’all instead.\n\nHockey\nI grew up in San Jose during the San Jose Sharks “Golden Era,” so how could I not love hockey. I got to grow up watching all of their playoff runs, year after year, and now comes the time that I get to watch them rebuild a new core with the hopes of reaching their next new generation of top tier players. I went to my first hockey game when I was a toddler, and cried over the shark head that the team skates out of, and I got a free SJ Sharkie plushie out of it. I also think that hockey is just one of the most interesting sports, since it’s fast paced, you can see the plays develop, and you don’t get super hot sitting out in the stands all day in the sun.\n\n\n\n\nShark Head Lowering to the Ice\n\n\n\n\n\nSJ Sharkie with win sign\n\n\n\n\n\nSAP Center during Sharks Intermission\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking\nAnother thing that I have been super into recently is cooking. I’ve always enjoyed baking, but I over the past year I’ve started finding more recipes online and making dinner for me and my friends. I realized that cooking and baking aren’t too different, and cooking offers a lot more freedom since it doesn’t have to be as exact as baking because a little bit too much of one ingredient isn’t going to jeopardize how it cooks. I wanted to include some of the things that I’ve made recently, but I realized that I don’t have any pictures of it. That being said, the last couple things I’ve made were: chicken tikka masala, creamy mushroom pasta, and a chili oil vodka sauce with pasta.\n\n\nTraveling\nOne of the things I wish I could do more, but can’t right now given my schedule, is traveling. I used to travel a lot with my parents over the summer between the school years, and we went to some super cool places. I’ve been to London, Dublin, a few different cities in Italy, Austria, France, and more. I’m really hoping that after I graduate I’ll get the chance to travel more. Some of the places that I haven’t been, but would really like to visit are Amsterdam, Greece, and Spain.\n\n\n\n\nTemple Bar, Dublin, Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nKing’s Cross Station, London, England"

My two cats, Pigeon and Minnow, are going to be turning 5 this July(ish), and my childhood cat, Marcel, is an old man now at 17. We rescued Marcel from our backyard when I was going into Kindergarten, and then we did the same thing for Pigeon and Minnow when I was going into my Senior year of high school. I also have a jumping spider, and he likes to watch TV with me and my roommates from his enclosure, but I won’t include a picture of him because he can freak people out sometimes.\n\n\n\n\nMinnow\n\n\n\n\n\nPigeon\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcel\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoors!\nAside from my pets, I love spending time outside, whether it be going on a hike or lounging around at the beach. I grew up going up to Redding, CA a lot, so I also got to spend time out of the city-scape of San Jose and enjoy the beauty of the Sacramento River and Mt. Shasta. One thing that I’ve picked up from my time in Santa Barbara is tidepooling, which I had never really done at the Santa Cruz beaches, but I had gone a few times in Monterrey.\n\n\n\n\nSacramento River from Sundial Bridge, Redding, CA\n\n\n\n\n\nMt.

    "text": "These are some of the courses that I’ve taken that have helped me expand my skill sets. I have included an example of a project from each course in the Projects tab of this site.\n\nGEOG W 12: Maps and Spatial Reasoning\nThis course introduced me to basic ArcGIS Pro concepts and what I could use it for, it helped create a foundation for me to build upon in later classes. I learned the basics of map abstraction, generalization, projections, and symbolization needed in order to create maps and use ArcGIS Pro to help me analyze spatial data.\n\n\nENVS154: GIS for Environmental Applications\nThis course helped build on my previous class about ArcGIS Pro, diving deeper into how environmental researchers and professionals can use GIS in order to help analyze and communicate spatial patterns. I learned a lot about how to maps properly, and apply the skills I learned in order to create a StoryMap at the end of the course that analyzes how habitat corridors are impacted by various natural and anthropogenic threats.\n\n\nENVS137: Conservation Planning\nThis course introduced me to Miradi, a program used to help streamline the conservation planning process. I learned how to identify fundamental objectives, features, indicators, and targets in a way that creates a cohesive conservation plan. I learned the ins and outs of the field, as well as got a feeling for mitigating some of the problems can often come up during the planning process. I got the opportunity to work on a real world project, and I worked with a group of 4 other people to help build a plan that will help increase the water resiliency of the Jalama Valley Ranch Property.\n\n\nENVS193DS: Statistics for Environmental Studies\nThis course has helped me gain confidence in my ability to analyze data and taught me valuable skills in RStudio. I now feel like I have a better handle on knowing which analytical tests to use in different situations, as well as being able to better convey the data I find through the plots and visualizations that I can make. This course has also helped me grow in my ability to interpret and contextualize the results I get from my analysis in both statistical and day-to-day dialect."
