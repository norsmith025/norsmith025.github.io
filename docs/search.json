I’m from San Jose, CA, just about 4.5 hours north of sunny Santa Barbara, and grew up going to the Santa Cruz beaches all the time. I transfered here as a third-year from De Anza Community College in Cupertino, CA, but before that I went to Portland State University for my Freshman year before I decided that the coast was calling me back. I’ll be finishing up my studies here this summer (2025) and can’t wait to see what the future holds!"

    "text": "As you’ve probably figured out by now, my name is Nora Smith and I’m going to be graduating from UCSB soon with my Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies, but there’s more to me than that.\n\nPets!\nI’ll start with the basics, I have 3 cats at home, two of which are mine, and one that’s my parents’. My two cats, Pigeon and Minnow, are going to be turning 5 this July(ish), and my childhood cat, Marcel, is an old man now at 17. We rescued Marcel from our backyard when I was going into Kindergarten, and then we did the same thing for Pigeon and Minnow when I was going into my Senior year of high school. I also have a jumping spider, and he likes to watch TV with me and my roommates from his enclosure, but I won’t include a picture of him because he can freak people out sometimes.\n\n\n\n\nMinnow\n\n\n\n\n\nPigeon\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcel\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoors!\nAside from my pets, I love spending time outside, whether it be going on a hike or lounging around at the beach. I grew up going up to Redding, CA a lot, so I also got to spend time out of the city-scape of San Jose and enjoy the beauty of the Sacramento River and Mt. Shasta. One thing that I’ve picked up from my time in Santa Barbara is tidepooling, which I had never really done at the Santa Cruz beaches, but I had gone a few times in Monterrey.\n\n\n\n\nSacramento River from Sundial Bridge, Redding, CA\n\n\n\n\n\nMt. Shasta from CA I-5\n\n\n\n\n\nLake Siskiyou Camp Grounds\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of my favorite places!\ninteractive map here"

    "text": "These are some of the courses that I’ve taken that have helped me expand my skill sets. I have included an example of a project from each course in the Projects tab of this site.\n\nGEOG W 12: Maps and Spatial Reasoning\nThis course introduced me to basic ArcGIS Pro concepts and what I could use it for, it helped create a foundation for me to build upon in later classes. I learned the basics of map abstraction, generalization, projections, and symbolization needed in order to create maps and use ArcGIS Pro to help me analyze spatial data.\n\n\nENVS154: GIS for Environmental Applications\nThis course helped build on my previous class about ArcGIS Pro, diving deeper into how environmental researchers and professionals can use GIS in order to help analyze and communicate spatial patterns. I learned a lot about how to maps properly, and apply the skills I learned in order to create a StoryMap at the end of the course that analyzes how habitat corridors are impacted by various natural and anthropogenic threats.\n\n\nENVS137: Conservation Planning\nThis course introduced me to Miradi, a program used to help streamline the conservation planning process. I learned how to identify fundamental objectives, features, indicators, and targets in a way that creates a cohesive conservation plan. I learned the ins and outs of the field, as well as got a feeling for mitigating some of the problems can often come up during the planning process. I got the opportunity to work on a real world project, and I worked with a group of 4 other people to help build a plan that will help increase the water resiliency of the Jalama Valley Ranch Property.\n\n\nENVS193DS: Statistics for Environmental Studies\nThis course has helped me gain confidence in my ability to analyze data and taught me valuable skills in RStudio. I now feel like I have a better handle on knowing which analytical tests to use in different situations, as well as being able to better convey the data I find through the plots and visualizations that I can make. This course has also helped me grow in my ability to interpret and contextualize the results I get from my analysis in both statistical and day-to-day dialect."
