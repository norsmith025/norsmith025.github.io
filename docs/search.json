    "text": "Hey there, thanks for stopping by my website! I’m Nora and I’m a fourth-year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara majoring in Environmental Studies. I’m from San Jose, CA, just about 4.5 hours north of sunny Santa Barbara, and grew up going to the Santa Cruz beaches all the time. I transfered here as a third-year from De Anza Community College in Cupertino, CA, but before that I went to Portland State University for my Freshman year before I decided that the coast was calling me back. I’ll be finishing up my studies here this summer (2025) and can’t wait to see what the future holds!"

    "text": "As you’ve probably figured out by now, my name is Nora Smith and I’m going to be graduating from UCSB soon with my Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies, but there’s more to me than that.\n\nPets!\nI’ll start with the basics, I have 3 cats at home, two of which are mine, and one that’s my parents’. My two cats, Pigeon and Minnow, are going to be turning 5 this July(ish), and my childhood cat, Marcel, is an old man now at 17. We rescued Marcel from our backyard when I was going into Kindergarten, and then we did the same thing for Pigeon and Minnow when I was going into my Senior year of high school. I also have a jumping spider, and he likes to watch TV with me and my roommates from his enclosure, but I won’t include a picture of him because he can freak people out sometimes.\n\n\n\n\nMinnow\n\n\n\n\n\nPigeon\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcel\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoors!\nAside from my pets, I love spending time outside, whether it be going on a hike or lounging around at the beach. I grew up going up to Redding, CA a lot, so I also got to spend time out of the city-scape of San Jose and enjoy the beauty of the Sacramento River and Mt. Shasta. One thing that I’ve picked up from my time in Santa Barbara is tidepooling, which I had never really done at the Santa Cruz beaches, but I had gone a few times in Monterrey.\n\n\n\n\nSacramento River from Sundial Bridge, Redding, CA\n\n\n\n\n\nMt. Shasta from CA I-5\n\n\n\n\n\nLake Siskiyou Camp Grounds\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of my favorite places!\ninteractive map here"
