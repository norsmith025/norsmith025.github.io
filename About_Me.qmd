title: "About Me"
---

As you've probably figured out by now, my name is Nora Smith and I'm going to be graduating from UCSB soon with my Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Studies, but there's more to me than that.

I'll start with the basics, I have 3 cats at home, two of which are mine, and one that's my parents'. My two cats, Pigeon and Minnow, are going to be turning 5 this July(ish), and my childhood cat, Marcel, is an old man now at 17.
